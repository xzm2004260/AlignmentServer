13.310417	Talkin' in my sleep at night,
15.139583	Makin' myself crazy
17.939583	(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
21.669792	Wrote it down and read it out,
23.800000	Hopin' it would save me
25.880208	(Too many times, too many times)
29.710417	My love, he makes me feel
32.789583	like nobody else, nobody else
37.139583	But my love, he doesn't love me,
40.930208	so I tell myself, I tell myself
46.180208	One, don't pick up the phone
48.400000	You know he's only calling
49.700000	'cause he's drunk and alone two

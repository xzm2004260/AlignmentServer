I've been fuckin hoes and poppin pillies
Man, I feel just like a rockstar (star)
all my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, man them the shottas
When my homies pull up on your block
They make that thing go grrra-ta-ta-ta
switch my whip,came back in black
I'm startin' sayin',
"Rest in peace to Bon Scott"
Close that door, we blowin' smoke
She ask me light a fire like I'm Morison
act a fool on stage Prolly leave my
fuckin show in a cop car
shit was legendary Threw a TV
out the window of the Montage
Cocaine on the table, liquor
pourin', don't give a damn
Dude, your girlfriend is a
groupie, she just tryna get in....
Sayin', "I'm with the band"....
They make that thing go grrra-ta-ta-ta

Y'all can't handle this
Y'all don't know whats
about to happen' baby
Team 10
Los Angeles - Cali boy
But I'm from Ohio tho - white bo
It's everyday bro
With the Disney channel flow
'Bout 5 mill on YouTube in 6 months
Never done before
We pass all the competition man
Pewdiepie is next
Man I'm poppin' all these checks
Got a brand new Rolex
And I met a Lambo too
And I'm coming with the crew
This is Team 10, b^tch
Who the hell are flippin' you?
And you know I kick them out
If they ain't with the crew
Yeah, I'm talking about you
You beggin for attention
Talking sh^t on Twitter too
But you still hit my phone last night
It was 4:52 and I got the text to prove
And all the recordings too
Don't make me tell them the truth
And I just drop some new merch
And they are selling like a God church
Ohio is where I'm from
We chew'em like it's gum
We shooting with a gun
The tattoo just for fun
And you say boat and run
Catch me at game on
I can not be outdone
Jake Paulers number one
It's everyday bro
It's everyday bro
It's everyday bro
I said it is everyday bro!
You know is Nick Crompton
And my collar stay poppin'
Yes, I can rap
And no, I am not from Compton
England is my city
And if you work for Team 10
Then the US would be sh^tty
And I'll pass it to Chance
'Cuz you know he stay litty
Two months ago
You didn't know my name
And now you want my fame?
B^tch I'm blowin' up
I'm only going up
Now, I'm going off
I'm never fallin' off
Like Magg, who?
Digi who?
Who are you?
All these beefs I just ran through
Hit a million in a month
Where were you?
Hatin' on me back in West
Thinking need to get your sh^t straight
Jakey brought me to the top
Now, we're really poppin' on
Number 1 and number 4
That's why these fans all out the door
It's lonely at the top
So we all going
We left Ohio
Now the trio is all rollin'
It's Team 10, b^tch
We back again, always first, never last
We the future, we'll see you in the past
It's everyday bro
It's everyday bro
It's everyday bro
I said it is everyday bro!
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Can we switch the language?
Si, lo unico que quiero es dinero
Trabajando en YouTube todo el dia entero

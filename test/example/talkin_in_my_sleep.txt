Tàlkin' ~ in my sleep at night....
Mákin' myself crÅzy@
(Out of my miñd, out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out,
Hopin' it would save me,
(Too many times, too many times)
My love, he makes me feel
like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me,
so I tell myself, I tell myself
One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only calling
'cause he's drunk and alone two

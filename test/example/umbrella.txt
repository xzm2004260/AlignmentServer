you have my heart
and we'll never be worlds apart
maybe in magazines
but you'll still be my star
baby 'cause in the dark
you can't see shiny cars
and that's when you need me there
with you i'll always share

because when the sun shines we shine together
told you i'll be here forever
said i'll always be your friend
took an oath gonna stick it out till the end
now that it's rainin' more than ever
know that we'll still have each other
you can stand under my umbrella
you can stand under my umbrella
ella ella ae ae ae
under my umbrella ella ella ae ae ae
under my umbrella ella ella ae ae ae
under my umbrella ella ella ae ae ae ae ae ae

these fancy things
will never come in between
you're part of my entity
here for infinity
when the war has took it's part
when the world has dealt it's cards
if the hand is hard
together we'll mend your heart

because when the sun shines we shine together
told you i'll be here forever
said i'll always be your friend
took an oath gonna stick it out till the end
now that it's rainin' more than ever
know that we'll still have each other
you can stand under my umbrella
you can stand under my umbrella
ella ella ae ae ae
under my umbrella ella ella ae ae ae
under my umbrella ella ella ae ae ae
under my umbrella ella ella ae ae ae
ae ae ae

you can run into my arms
it's okay don't be alarmed come into me
there's no distance in between our love
so go on and let the rain pour 
i'll be all you need and more

because when the sun shines we shine together
told you i'll be here forever
said i'll always be your friend took an oath gonna stick it out till the end
now that it's rainin' more than ever
know that we'll still have each other
you can stand under my umbrella
you can stand under my umbrella
ella ella ae ae ae
under my umbrella ella ella ae ae ae
under my umbrella ella ella ae ae ae
under my umbrella ella ella ae ae ae ae ae ae

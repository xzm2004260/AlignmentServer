  Bring the beat in  
Honey, honey, I can see the stars all the way from here 
Can't you see the glow on the window pane? I can feel the sun whenever you're near 
Every time you touch me I just melt away  
Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear, but I know, oh oh 
Nothing's perfect, but it's worth it, after fighting through my tears, and finally you put me first  
Baby, it's you, you're the one I love, you're the one I need, you're the only thing I see 
Come on, baby, it's you, you're the one that gives your all, you're the one I can always call 
When I need you, make everything stop, finally, you put my love on top Post 
Ooh, come on, baby! You put my love on top, top, top, top, top 
You put my love on top, ooh, come on, baby! 
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top, my love on top  
Baby, baby, I can feel the wind whipping past my face, as we dance the night away 
Boy your lips taste like a night of champagne, as I kiss you again, and again, and again, and again  
Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear, but I know, oh oh 
Nothing's perfect, but it's worth it, after fighting through my tears, and finally you put me first  
Baby, it's you, you're the one I love, you're the one I need, you're the only thing I see 
Come on, baby, it's you, you're the one that gives your all, you're the one I can always call 
When I need you make everything stop, finally, you put my love on top Post 
Ooh, come on, baby! You put my love on top, top, top, top, top 
You put my love on top, ooh, come on, baby! 
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top, my love on top  
Baby, it's you, you're the one I love, you're the one I need, you're the only thing I see 
Come on, baby, it's you, you're the one that gives your all, you're the one I can always call 
When I need you make everything stop, finally, you put my love on top  
Baby, cause you're the one that I love, baby, you're all I need, you're the only thing I see 
Oh baby, baby it's you, you're the one that gives your all, you're the one I always call 
When I need make everything stop, finally, you put my love on top  
Baby, 'cause you're the one that I love, baby, you're all I need, you're the only thing I see 
Oh baby, baby, it's you, you're the one that gives your all, you're the one that always calls 
When I need you make everything stops, finally you put my love on top  
Baby, 'cause you're the one that I love, baby, you're all I need, you're the only thing I see 
Oh baby, baby, it's you, you're the one that gives your all, you're the one that always calls 
When I need you make everything stops, finally you put my love on top

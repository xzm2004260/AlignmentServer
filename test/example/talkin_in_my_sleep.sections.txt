13.310417	15.139583	Talkin' in my sleep at night,
15.139583	17.939583	Makin' myself crazy
17.939583	21.669792	(Out of my mind, out of my mind)

21.669792	23.800000	Wrote it down and read it out,
23.800000	25.880208	Hopin' it would save me
25.880208	29.710417	(Too many times, too many times)

29.710417	32.789583	My love, he makes me feel
32.789583	37.139583	like nobody else, nobody else
37.139583	40.930208	But my love, he doesn't love me,
40.930208	46.180208	so I tell myself, I tell myself

46.180208	48.400000	One, don't pick up the phone
48.400000	49.700000	You know he's only calling
49.700000	51.37	'cause he's drunk and alone two
